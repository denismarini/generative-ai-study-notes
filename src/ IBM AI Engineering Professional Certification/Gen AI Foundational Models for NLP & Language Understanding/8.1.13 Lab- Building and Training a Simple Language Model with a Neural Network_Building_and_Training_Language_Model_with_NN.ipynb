Perplexity is commonly used in natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, speech recognition, and language generation.\n","\n","Perplexity is derived from the concept of cross-entropy loss, which measures the dissimilarity between predicted probabilities and actual probabilities. \n","\n","$$\\text{Cross-Entropy Loss} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \\ln(p_i)$$\n","The cross-entropy loss is calculated by taking the negative sum of the products of the true labels $y_i$ and the logarithm of the predicted probabilities $p_i$ over $N$ classes.\n","\n","Taking the exponential of the mean cross-entropy loss gives us the perplexity value.\n","\n","$$\\text{Perplexity} = e^{\\frac{1}{N} \\text{Cross-Entropy Loss}}$$\n","\n","\n","A lower perplexity value indicates that the model is more confident and accurate in predicting the data. Conversely, a higher perplexity suggests that the model is less certain and less accurate in its predictions.\n","\n","Perplexity can be seen as an estimate of the average number of choices the model has for the next word or event in a sequence. A lower perplexity means that the model is more certain about the next word, while a higher perplexity means that there are more possible choices.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"a771c38b-7cf6-4180-8c9c-4e656c1c9f2f","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["for (my_loss, model_name)in zip(my_loss_list,[\"2-gram\",\"4-gram\",\"8-gram\"]):\n    # Calculate perplexity using the loss\n    perplexity = np.exp(my_loss)\n    plt.plot(perplexity,label=\"Perplexity - {}\".format(model_name))\n    plt.legend()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"02789003-16ff-45c2-9515-c63835efec4b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Exercises\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ebe2b5b9-a4ff-4172-ad88-2876d1e3fd59","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Exercise 1 - Source a collection of nursery rhymes and compile them into a single text variable.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"b98f2e6c-40fd-46d0-9985-aa41ef5bd897","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["nursery_rhymes = "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6f4bb704-75e9-4b88-90ee-913da4d86507","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["<details>\n","    <summary>Click here for Solution</summary>\n","\n","```python\n","nursery_rhymes = \"\"\"\n","Little Miss Muffet\n","Sat on a tuffet,\n","Eating her curds and whey;\n","Along came a spider\n","Who sat down beside her\n","And frightened Miss Muffet away.\n","\n","Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n","How I wonder what you are!\n","Up above the world so high,\n","Like a diamond in the sky.\n","\n","Baa, baa, black sheep,\n","Have you any wool?\n","Yes sir, yes sir,\n","Three bags full.\n","\n","Jack and Jill went up the hill\n","To fetch a pail of water.\n","Jack fell down and broke his crown,\n","And Jill came tumbling after.\n","\n","Hickory dickory dock,\n","The mouse ran up the clock.\n","The clock struck one,\n","The mouse ran down,\n","Hickory dickory dock.\n","\n","Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,\n","Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.\n","All the king's horses and all the king's men\n","Couldn't put Humpty together again.\n","\n","Mary had a little lamb,\n","Its fleece was white as snow;\n","And everywhere that Mary went,\n","The lamb was sure to go.\n","\n","Old MacDonald had a farm,\n","E-I-E-I-O,\n","And on his farm he had a cow,\n","E-I-E-I-O.\n","\n","Itsy Bitsy Spider climbed up the waterspout.\n","Down came the rain and washed the spider out.\n","Out came the sun and dried up all the rain,\n","And the Itsy Bitsy Spider climbed up the spout again.\n","\n","The wheels on the bus go round and round,\n","Round and round,\n","Round and round.\n","The wheels on the bus go round and round,\n","All through the town.\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","```\n","\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1bb990e8-1162-4cbd-8f0c-c49b7ee8a4a3","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Exercise 2 - Preprocess the text data to tokenize and create n-grams.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"4be53b05-f1e4-46d6-b659-54622b0052e1","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3f5fb61d-1bda-4fd1-929c-036644212609","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["<details>\n","    <summary>Click here for Solution</summary>\n","\n","```python\n","N=2\n","tokens = preprocess(nursery_rhymes)  # Use the preprocess function provided in the code.\n","ngrams = list(nltk.ngrams(tokens, N))  # Where N is the size of the n-gram (2, 4, 8, etc.).\n","```\n","\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3af9b45a-b878-4f4e-96fb-863cf3c3cccd","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Exercise 3 - Train an N-gram language model using the provided code structure.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"2fa0eb05-83c9-45cf-8e35-e998752f56b4","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"96867fcc-977f-48fe-af20-3c26fb19c736","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["<details>\n","    <summary>Click here for Solution</summary>\n","\n","```python\n","model = NGramLanguageModeler(len(vocab), EMBEDDING_DIM, CONTEXT_SIZE).to(device)\n","optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)\n","scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, 1.0, gamma=0.1)\n","loss_history = train(dataloader, model)\n","```\n","\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a88d0f72-8adb-473b-85dc-4e44491298de","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Exercise 4 - After training, use the model to generate a new nursery rhyme and then print it.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"bf556c52-85c2-4610-983d-e87d61d72f62","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d6846c25-d9c5-4155-9f0e-528c8d00b467","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["<details>\n","    <summary>Click here for Solution</summary>\n","\n","```python\n","generated_rhyme = write_song(model)\n","print(generated_rhyme)\n","```\n","\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"69858eec-9a1d-4f80-b7d5-c8429f85d3b2","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d31cbb08-ee3a-4c05-b2a9-54ddf8b12553","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Congratulations!
