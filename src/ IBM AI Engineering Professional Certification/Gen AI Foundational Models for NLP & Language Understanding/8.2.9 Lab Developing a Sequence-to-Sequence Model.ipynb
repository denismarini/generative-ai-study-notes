In most cases, the rows (the first dimension) in a PyTorch tensor represent individual samples, while the columns (the second dimension) represent features or time steps in the case of sequences. When dealing with sequences in PyTorch, it's common to use functions like `pad_sequence` to ensure that all sequences have the same length. Surprisingly, the padding operation is applied along the second dimension (columns), even though sequences are typically represented in the first dimension (rows). This can be confusing at first due to the way batches of sequences are represented. In many sequence-related tasks in PyTorch, especially when working with recurrent models like RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, batches of sequences are usually represented with the shape [sequence_length, batch_size, feature_size], where `sequence_length` refers to the length of the longest sequence within the batch(here it is equevalent to `src_len` or `trg_len`). If you check the src tensor above, you can see that the first word of of all sentences are in the first line, the second word of all sentences are in the second line, etc. That is why the first dimension is the length of the sequence.\n","\n","    When you use `pad_sequence`, it adds padding to the sequences in a batch so that they all have the same length, matching the length of the longest sequence. Since sequences are represented in the first dimension, the padding is applied along that dimension. As a result, the output tensor from `pad_sequence` will have the format [sequence_length, batch_size]. (Check the output for `src` and `trg` from the above cell.) This convention is commonly used because models like LSTMs expect the data to be in this format. However, if you're accustomed to working with more traditional tabular data in PyTorch, it can initially cause confusion. It's important to be aware of this convention to avoid potential errors and understand how to properly prepare and format sequence data for your models.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f475836f-cc71-4f67-bf2f-2fc93f44db28","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Training the model\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ae3f8b3e-287f-42ad-a8d9-5cdb11ea172e","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["> **Note:** **Please be aware that training the model using CPUs can be a time-consuming process.
