BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) has revolutionized natural language processing tasks by capturing contextual information from both left and right contexts. To harness the power of BERT, you will cover various topics, including random sample selection, tokenization, vocabulary building, text masking, and data preparation for masked language model (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) tasks. By the end of this project, you will have the skills to preprocess your data and create training-ready inputs for BERT models.
