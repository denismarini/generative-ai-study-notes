    "As an AI engineer working on a cutting-edge language translation project, you are tasked with bridging the communication gap between speakers of different languages. Translating languages is no small feat, especially given the intricacies, nuances, and cultural contexts embedded within them. Central to the success of this endeavor is the data - large corpora of bilingual sentences that serve as the bedrock of your models.\n",

    "In PyTorch, the data loader plays an indispensable role in managing this vast amount of data. For natural language processing (NLP) tasks like yours, data often comes in variable lengths due to differing sentence structures and lengths across languages. The data loader efficiently batches these variable-length sequences, ensuring that your models are trained on diverse examples in every iteration. This batching is crucial for harnessing the power of parallel computation on GPUs, thus expediting the training process.\n",

    "Furthermore, the data loader aids in shuffling the data set, which is vital for preventing models from memorizing the sequence of training data and promoting better generalization. Especially for NLP tasks, where data might be ordered or clustered by topics, shuffling ensures that the model remains robust and doesn't develop biases based on the order of input.\n",

The data loader in PyTorch provides hooks that allow us to seamlessly integrate these preprocessing steps, ensuring that the raw textual data is transformed into a format that's amenable for deep learning models.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Data loader**\n",
    "\n",
    "A data loader in **PyTorch** is responsible for efficiently loading and batching data from a data set. It abstracts away the process of iterating over a data set, shuffling, and dividing it into batches for training. In NLP applications, the data loader is used to process and transform your text data, rather than just the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data loaders have several key parameters, including the data set to load from, batch size (determining how many samples per batch), shuffle (whether to shuffle the data for each epoch), and more. Data loaders also provide an iterator interface, making it easy to iterate over batches of data during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may ask, '**What is an iterator?**'\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object that can be looped over. It contains elements that can be iterated through and typically includes two methods, `__iter__()` and `__next__()`. When there are no more elements to iterate over, it raises a **`StopIteration`** exception.\n",

    "Iterators are commonly used to traverse large data sets without loading all elements into memory simultaneously, making the process more memory-efficient. In PyTorch, not all data sets are iterators, but all data loaders are.\n",

    "In PyTorch, the data loader processes data in batches, loading and processing one batch at a time into memory efficiently. The batch size, which you specify when creating the data loader, determines how many samples are processed together in each batch. The data loader's purpose is to convert input data and labels into batches of tensors with the same shape for deep learning models to interpret.\n",

    "## **Custom data set and data loader in PyTorch**\n",
    "In this code snippet, you will see how to create a custom data set and use the DataLoader class in PyTorch. The data set consists of a list of random sentences, and the objective is to create batches of sentences for further processing, such as training a neural network model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will begin by defining a custom data set called CustomDataset. This data set inherits from the `torch.utils.data.Dataset` class and is initialized with a list of sentences. The data set comprises two essential methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __init__(self, sentences): Initializes the data set with a list of sentences.\n",
    "- __getitem__(self, idx): Retrieves an item (in this case, a sentence) at a specific index, idx.\n",

    "Next, you create an instance of your custom data set (custom_dataset) by passing in the list of sentences. Additionally, you can specify a batch size (batch_size), which determines how many sentences will be grouped together in each batch during data loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then create a DataLoader (dataloader) by providing your custom data set and batch size to the torch.utils.data.DataLoader class. Furthermore, you set shuffle=True, indicating that the sentences will be randomly shuffled before being divided into batches. This shuffling is particularly useful for training deep learning models, as it prevents the model from learning patterns based on the order of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you iterate through the DataLoader to demonstrate how data is loaded in batches. In this code, you will see that batch size is set to 2, meaning that each batch will contain two sentences. The DataLoader efficiently manages the loading of data in batches, making it suitable for training deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "During iteration, the sentences in each batch are printed to illustrate how the DataLoader groups and presents the data. This code snippet provides a fundamental example of how to set up a custom data set and data loader in PyTorch, which is a common practice in deep learning workflows.\n"

It is used when a word in the input text is not found in the vocabulary or when dealing with words that are rare or unseen during training. When the model encounters an unknown word, it replaces it with the `<unk>` token.\n",

To create batches of data with uniform dimensions, shorter sequences are often padded with this `<pad>` token to match the length of the longest sequence in the batch.\n",
